# DICE CODE
## Write code while using your D&D supplies

## THE RULES
- You must write a d20 random number generator in a language with which you are only passingly familiar
- You can look stuff up on the internet, BUT
    - You must roll your d10 to determine which search result you will use. You may look at only that result.
    - You must run the code after you incorporate knowledge gained via search result
- Each time you run your code, you must also roll your d10 for a disadvantage. Disadvantage table is below.
- Chat can help at any time


## Disadvantage table
1. SINGLEHANDED: Type only with your non-dominant hand
2. ARR: Read each line you add in a pirate voice
3. CARTOONISH: Change your font to comic sans
4. BIG OR SMALL: Roll your D6. Change your font to 2x the result.
5. 1000 DUCK-SIZED HORSES: Clap your hands every time you type a semicolon
